### Ice cream is the best.

I scream, you scream, we all scream, because there's no more ice cream. No one's rhyming about spinach.

Here is a description of this heavenly nectar from wikipedia on [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream): 

> Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream 
> and flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative,
> and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as 
> strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a 
> flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring
> is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is 
> cooled below he freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate 
> air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.     
> crystals from forming. he result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that 
> is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes
> more malleable as its temperature increases.
